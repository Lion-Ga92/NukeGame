## Welcome to my Nuclear Triad Launch Systems CLI application. It is a simple sim that makes you enter a few digits into the CLI.
This is a very basic app and i wanna go back to it to improve it. 
my first goal is to actually develop the CLI with an ASCII Interface. To give it more of an interesting look. 
There are of course several pop references in the program to keep it light and not be a very official looking CLI. 
Afterwards i intend to develop it into a a simple GUI app with tkinter. 
For this i will need to work on the following stuff
* I need keep studying Python
* I need to learn OOP
* I need to edit the CLI app to shorter the amount of code lines. Through classes. 
* I need to edit the app to add ASSCII Intefaces. 
* I need to learn tkinter
* or other GUI framework
* Add media

#### These are the ones at most of the top of my head
I'll keep working on it through out on.
