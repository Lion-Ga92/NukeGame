OK we must add a few notes here cuz it seems that for some reason when i try to push the local git to the github
i end up somehow not targetting an actual src ref which means that it is unable to load the files. 
but if i do the following process it does seems to allow me to push to github
i will signal the steps in #
#git init 
#git add "some files"
#git commit -m "the notes"
#git push
#At this stage i need the log in data#
#Username
#Password
